            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Task Overview:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Teams must design and build a manually controlled robot that moves a ball towards the opponent's goal, without gripping or grabbing the ball.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Team Description:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A team can have 2 to 4 members, and participants may come from different educational institutions, including Engineering, Undergraduate, or Postgraduate students. Each team is allowed to submit one robot for the competition.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Gameplay and Fouls:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>At the start of each half, the ball is placed in the center circle.</li>
            <li>Both robots begin at their respective goalposts.</li>
            <li>After a goal is scored, the ball placed back to the center circle, and both bots return to their goalposts.</li>
            <li>If a bot stops working, the opponent cannot score until the bot resumes functioning. If a goal is scored while a bot is inactive, it counts as a foul.</li>
            <li>If a bot commits a foul, the ball is placed back in the center, and the non-fouling team starts from the center circle. The fouling bot cannot leave the goalpost, till the attacker touches the ball.</li>
        </ul>
